## PyCity 

The PyCity application reads from two csv files and then merges them into a dataframe to be used. PyCity then calculates total amount of school, student count, total budget, average reading score, average math score, and passing scores for reading and math. These calculations are then put into a dataframe to give a overall district summary. Then PyCity merges the data by school name using calculations to get school type, students per school, budget per student in every school, students passing reading, students passing math, and overall passing both. PyCity then creates a dataframe showing this data to give a overall view per each school in the district. PyCity then calculates the highest performing schools and bottom performing schools. Next PyCity calculates math scores by each grade level and then with reading scores as well. Then PyCity using bins to create another column labelled Spending Ranges(Per Student) using the pd.cut funciton. PyCity calculates averages for reading and math scores grouping by spending ranges. Then PyCity creates another dataframe showing spending ranges in relation to average scores. Next PyCity uses pd.cut and bins to add a school size column ranging from small, medium, and large. PyCity then calcualtes the average math and reading scores again and creates a dataframe by school size. Lastly PyCity calculates average math and reading scores into another dataframe by school type.
